I am Misba Saman, a technology leader with a Masterâ€™s degree in Cloud Computing from the University of Leicester, UK â€” a program that laid a strong foundation in secure, scalable, and innovative cloud solutions. Complementing this, I am a UX-Certified Product Manager from the University of Toronto, where I gained specialized training in human-centered design to ensure that technical solutions are not only powerful but also intuitive and user-friendly.

In addition, I am an AWS-Certified Solutions Architect, HIPAA Compliance Certified, and hold dual AWS certifications. My expertise spans AWS architecture (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, CloudFormation, API Gateway, Cognito, DynamoDB, KMS, CloudWatch), systems analysis, and regulated industry requirements, including HIPAA-ready architectures and healthcare data flows.

What sets me apart is the ability to bridge the gap between technical architecture and human-centered design â€” combining skills in AWS cloud infrastructure with hands-on product strategy, usability testing, user interviews, and competitive analysis. This ensures that the products I deliver meet business and compliance needs while also delighting end-users.

Based in Boston and TN-eligible under USMCA/NAFTA, I am available for immediate US-based or remote opportunities. Whether architecting multi-tier cloud systems or leading user research, I focus on delivering solutions that are technically robust, business-aligned, and genuinely impactful.
