Iâ€™m an AWS-Certified Solutions Architect and UX-Certified Product Manager with a Masterâ€™s in Cloud Computing from the University of Leicester, UK. Holding dual AWS certifications and specialized training in UX Design from the University of Toronto, I bridge the gap between technical architecture and human-centered design to deliver secure, scalable, and user-friendly solutions.

My expertise spans AWS architecture (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, CloudFormation, API Gateway, Cognito, DynamoDB, KMS, CloudWatch), systems analysis, and regulated industry requirements, including HIPAA-ready architectures and healthcare data flows . I combine these technical skills with experience in product strategy, usability testing, user interviews, and competitive analysis to create products that meet both business and compliance needs while delighting users.

Based in Boston and TN-eligible under USMCA/NAFTA, Iâ€™m available for immediate US-based or remote roles. Whether architecting multi-tier cloud systems or leading user research, I focus on delivering solutions that are technically robust, business-aligned, and genuinely impactful.
